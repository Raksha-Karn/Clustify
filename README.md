# ðŸ“Š Clustify - K-Means Clustering from Scratch

This project implements the **K-Means Clustering algorithm** using NumPy â€” a fundamental unsupervised learning technique for grouping data into `k` distinct clusters based on similarity.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Custom K-Means clustering without using scikit-learn's built-in clustering tools.
- Uses NumPy for numerical operations and distance calculations.
- Visualizes clustering results using Matplotlib.
- Clean and modular class-based implementation.
- Adjustable number of clusters (`k`) and iterations.

## ðŸ§  What is K-Means?

K-Means is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for clustering data into **k groups**. It works by:

1. Randomly initializing `k` centroids.
2. Assigning each data point to the nearest centroid (based on Euclidean distance).
3. Recomputing centroids as the mean of all assigned points.
4. Repeating steps 2â€“3 until convergence or reaching max iterations.

## ðŸ§° Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **NumPy** for mathematical computations
- **Matplotlib** for visualization
- **scikit-learn** (only for generating synthetic datasets using `make_blobs`)
